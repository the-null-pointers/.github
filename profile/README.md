# The Null Pointers

**We break bugs, not code.**  
Welcome to the official GitHub organization of **The Null Pointers**, a team of passionate developers, designers, and innovators who came together during **CodeFest 2024** — Nepal’s largest hackathon — to build tech that solves real problems.

## 🚀 Our Story: CodeFest 2024 — Kathmandu, Nepal

In the heart of Nepal’s buzzing tech scene, **CodeFest 2024** brought together the brightest young minds in a 48-hour sprint of creativity and caffeine. Among them was a newly-formed team of curious individuals who had one goal: **to build something meaningful**.

That’s where **The Null Pointers** was born.

We didn’t have years of experience or corporate titles. What we had was:
- **A shared vision** to improve lives through technology.
- **A lot of coffee**.
- And a bold project idea: **MedTracker** — a digital health record system tailored for Nepal.

In just two days, we brainstormed, coded, laughed, struggled, and pushed ourselves to the limit. But at the end of it all, we walked away with:
- A working prototype of MedTracker
- A stronger belief in the power of collaboration

## 💡 What We Believe In

- **Open Source for Good:** We believe technology should be accessible and impactful.
- **Learning by Building:** Every project is a classroom. We fail fast, learn faster.
- **Team Over Titles:** We’re here to grow together. Ego is the only thing we leave at the door.
- **Solving Real Problems:** We love ideas, but we love execution more. Our projects aim to serve real communities.
